PS: Because the packaged files are too big and there are too many images in the folder to upload them centrally, so I uploaded the code and runtime files in batches, you can check them out one by one by clicking the link below:

In the field of art and design, I seek to explore new avenues of creative expression through stylistic transfer techniques. Stylistic transfer is an enticing technique that utilises the structure of content images and the stylistic patterns of example stylised images to create artistic expression (Lin, T. et al., 2021). This technique not only replicates the style of classical artworks, but presents my designs in a form that modern audiences can appreciate and interact with. Using code as a medium, I aim to re-imagine traditional art and highlight the role of technology in promoting cultural heritage and artistic innovation.

My work delves into the boundaries of stylistic transitions, seeking to enrich other images with Van Gogh's brushstrokes and colour rhythms while retaining their original content. This exploration stems from my understanding of the Laplace Pyramid Network for Rapid High-Quality Artistic Stylistic Transfers, a LapStyle network that transfers complex textures at a low resolution and refines the details at a high resolution, allowing for the rapid creation of high-quality stylised images. This method generates complex texture migration effects incrementally, while being able to achieve 100fps at 512 resolution. I used this method to fuse Van Gogh's paintings with 500 modern photographs, and the fused images were analysed for stylistic appropriateness, thus exploring the similarities and differences in the arts. However, it should be noted that LapStyle is a mono-stylistic network and does not currently support arbitrary stylisation.

Through this research, I hope to deepen my understanding of style transfer techniques and explore faster and more efficient ways to transform art styles.
